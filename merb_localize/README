merb_localize
=============

merb localize is a plugin that brings localization to merb. 
Basically it is a port of the gettext_localize[1] plugin for
rails, but it is now adjusted to merb.

To make your appication benefit from merb_localize you need
to install the merb_localize gem and add the dependency to
your merb configuraiton.


Installation
============
Install the gem and add the dependency to your merb 
configuration

    sudo gem install merb_localize
    
    ---
    
    dependency "merb_localize"

Setup
=====                        


Usage
=====

In your views you are now able to use the typical gettext
methods to mark your strings as localized. Once your strings
have been setup you can run the rake following rake tasks

    rake gettext:updatepo
    
This task will scan your view folders and create the *pot* file 
for you to localize. Once you translated the *pot* file and saved it 
according to the locale as a *po* file you need to convert them to
*mo* files. To do this call

    rake gettext:makemo
    
And you are done
